### What I learned

In this project I learned to used `<picture>` tag. by using `<picture>` tag Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.

The `<picture>` element contains two tags: one or more `<source>` tags and one `<img>` tag.

The browser will look for the first `<source>` element where the media query matches the current viewport width, and then it will display the proper image (specified in the srcset attribute). The `<img>` element is required as the last child of the `<picture>` element, as a fallback option if none of the source tags matches.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<picture>
  <source 
    srcset="./assets/images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
    media="(min-width: 500px)"
    loading="lazy"
  />
  <img 
    src="./assets/images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
    alt="Gabrielle chanel"
    loading="lazy"
  />
</picture>
```

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_picture.asp) - This helped me for understanding <picture> tag how it actually work. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand <picture> tag. I'd recommend it to anyone learning HTML.
